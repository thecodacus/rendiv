# Rendiv Video Skills

Use these skills whenever you are working with rendiv code — writing compositions,
animating elements, embedding media, or rendering output.

## Core Mental Model

Rendiv treats video as a **pure function of a frame number**. Every visual property
(position, opacity, color, scale) is derived from the current frame via `useFrame()`.
There is no timeline state machine, no imperative keyframe API. You write a React
component that accepts a frame and returns JSX — rendiv handles the rest.

```tsx
import { useFrame, interpolate } from '@rendiv/core';

export const FadeIn: React.FC = () => {
  const frame = useFrame();
  const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [0, 1], { extrapolateRight: 'clamp' });
  return <div style={{ opacity }}>Hello rendiv</div>;
};
```

### Key principles

- Every animation MUST be driven by `useFrame()`. CSS animations and transitions are
  forbidden — they run on wall-clock time and will desync during frame-by-frame rendering.
- Use `interpolate()` for linear mappings and `spring()` for physics-based motion.
- Use `<Img>`, `<Video>`, `<Audio>`, and `<AnimatedImage>` from `@rendiv/core` instead
  of native HTML elements — they integrate with the render lifecycle via `holdRender`.
- Compositions are registered declaratively via `<Composition>` and `<Still>` — they
  render `null` and only provide metadata to the framework.

## Quick Start

A minimal rendiv project entry point:

```tsx
// FadeIn.tsx — composition component
import { useFrame, interpolate, CanvasElement } from '@rendiv/core';

export const FadeIn: React.FC = () => {
  const frame = useFrame();
  const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [0, 1], { extrapolateRight: 'clamp' });
  return (
    <CanvasElement id="FadeIn">
      <div style={{ opacity }}>Hello rendiv</div>
    </CanvasElement>
  );
};
```

```tsx
// index.tsx — entry point
import { setRootComponent, Composition } from '@rendiv/core';
import { FadeIn } from './FadeIn';

const Root: React.FC = () => (
  <>
    <Composition
      id="FadeIn"
      component={FadeIn}
      durationInFrames={90}
      fps={30}
      width={1920}
      height={1080}
    />
  </>
);

setRootComponent(Root);
```

Render to MP4: `rendiv render src/index.tsx FadeIn out/fade-in.mp4`

Load the relevant rule file based on the task at hand:

| Task | Rule file |
|---|---|
| Animate with `interpolate`, `spring`, `Easing`, `blendColors` | [animation.md](rules/animation.md) |
| Set up compositions, stills, folders, entry point | [composition-setup.md](rules/composition-setup.md) |
| Time-shift with `Sequence`, `Series`, `Loop`, `Freeze` | [sequencing-and-timing.md](rules/sequencing-and-timing.md) |
| Control z-ordering and timeline overrides | [timeline-overrides.md](rules/timeline-overrides.md) |
| Embed images, video, audio, GIFs, iframes | [media-components.md](rules/media-components.md) |

| Add subtitles, SRT parsing, word highlighting | [captions.md](rules/captions.md) |

| Use the CLI, Studio, or Player | [cli-and-studio.md](rules/cli-and-studio.md) |

## Critical Constraints

1. **No CSS animations or transitions.** Everything MUST be frame-driven via `useFrame()`.
2. **Use rendiv media components** (`<Img>`, `<Video>`, `<Audio>`, `<AnimatedImage>`)
   instead of native HTML elements. They manage `holdRender` automatically.
3. **Always wrap composition content with `<CanvasElement id="...">`.** This makes
   the composition self-contained so its timeline overrides work correctly when nested
   inside other compositions. The `id` must match the `<Composition>` id.
4. **`<Composition>` renders null.** It only registers metadata. The actual component
   is rendered by the Player, Studio, or Renderer — not by `<Composition>` itself.
5. **`setRootComponent` can only be called once.** It registers the root that defines
   all compositions.
6. **`inputRange` must be monotonically non-decreasing** in `interpolate()` and
   `blendColors()`. Both ranges must have equal length with at least 2 elements.
7. **`<Series.Sequence>` must be a direct child of `<Series>`.** It throws if rendered
   outside a `<Series>` parent.
8. **`morphPath` requires matching segments.** Both paths must have the same number of
   segments with matching command types.
